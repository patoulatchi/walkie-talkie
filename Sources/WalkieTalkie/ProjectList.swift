/// `SpawnFolderMenu` used to name six folders hardcoded in Swift — the projects
/// Victor happened to be working on the afternoon it was written. That list is
/// wrong the week after and wrong *silently*: a project missing from it costs
/// the first sentence of every session started in it, spoken out loud to tell
/// the agent where it is, which is the exact cost the menu exists to remove.
///
/// | where | source | who decides |
/// |---|---|---|
/// | the menu itself | `PinnedProjects` — a file he edits by clicking a star | him, explicitly |
/// | the *Workspace ›* submenu | `WorkspaceFolders` — the folders with a file changed this month | the disk |
///
/// **The two are read the same way and written very differently**, and that is
/// the point of keeping them in one file: a pin is a decision and survives
/// everything, while the workspace listing is an observation and is replaced
/// wholesale by every scan.

/// The five most-worked repos of the fortnight, ranked off Claude Code's
/// transcripts (`RecentProjects`, 2026-09-08), sat under the pinned ones until
/// 2026-10-15 — Victor: *"I never used the last section of projects under the
/// last line … instead, put a menu called Workspace"*.

/// already present in the list … sorted descending by the last modified date of
/// any file within them … group them in sections … over the last day, then …
/// the last week, and the last month. And then inside each section … ascending
/// by name … with a star to get them onto the main list"*.

/// for their newest file reads ~290 000 entries and takes ~9 s (measured

/// is older than `maxAge`; the very first opening after a launch may say
