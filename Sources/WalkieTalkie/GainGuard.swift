/// Every 2 s, off the main thread, the device the relay records through
/// (`InputDevice.resolve`) is read:
/// - **volume ≥ `floor`** → remembered, per device name (`UserDefaults`), as the
///   level to go back to;
/// - **volume < `floor`** → set back to the remembered level, and the chip says
///   so (`🎚️ Elgato Wave XLR gain fell to 0% — put back to 72%`). No level
///   remembered yet (first run, or a device never seen up) → said once, nothing
///   written: there is no level of his to restore.
/// - **muted** → said once per mute, **never undone**: the XLR's tap-to-mute is
///   a deliberate gesture as often as an accidental one.
